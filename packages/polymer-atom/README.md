polymer-atom
=========================

A [Linter](https://github.com/AtomLinter/Linter) plugin that provides linting
for Polymer elements.

This linter is based on [Polylint](https://github.com/PolymerLabs/polylint), and looks for many common mistakes when writing Polymer components including:

- Missing imports
- Binding to a non-existing property
- Incorrect class bindings
- Missing computed property functions
- Broken observers

And much more!

## Installation

1. Install the [linter](https://atom.io/packages/linter) package with `apm install linter` or through Atom's [package installer interface](https://atom.io/docs/latest/using-atom-atom-packages)
2. Install the [polymer-atom](https://github.com/PolymerLabs/polymer-atom) package through `apm install polymer-atom` or through Atom's package installer.
3. Lint!
